# Browser-License-Plate-Enhancement
A small Javascript project for detecting license plates in the browser using TensorflowJS and AutoML models.

NodeJS is just used as a simple http server in this app.
This is mostly a proof of concept for a raspberry pi license plate enhancement project (not ALPR as there is no OCR for storing data.)
